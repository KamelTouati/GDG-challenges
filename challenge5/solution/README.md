This repository contains a JavaScript file, `main.js`, which is used for interacting with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using the Web3.js library. It demonstrates how to submit a secret value to a smart contract deployed at a specific address.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
2. The Web3.js library installed. You can install it using npm with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install web3
   ```
````

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KamelTouati/The-Magic-Number.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a file named `secret.js` to store your secret value. You can modify the value as needed:

   ```javascript
   // secret.js
   module.exports = "your secret value";
   ```

3. Modify the `main.js` file to use your secret value from `secret.js`:

   ```javascript
   const web3 = require("web3");
   const secretValue = require("./secret");

   const contractAddress =
     "0x31e297602c7bd8efbb7cfac5c52483d352c565211b2de826f454001d935e1239";

   const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress);

   contract.methods.submitSecretValue(secretValue).send();
   ```

4. Run the `main.js` script to interact with the smart contract:
   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```
