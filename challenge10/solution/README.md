# Palestinian Flag 3D Animation

A 3D representation of the Palestinian flag with a waving animation created using the Three.js library

## Description

This project showcases a 3D representation of the Palestinian flag and adds a realistic waving animation to simulate the flag's motion. The animation is created using Three.js, a popular 3D library for the web.

## Features

- Accurate representation of the Palestinian flag's colors and pattern.
- Realistic waving animation.
- Adjustable amplitude and frequency for the animation.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KamelTouati/palestinian-flag-3d.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the 3D flag animation.

3. Customize the animation by adjusting the `amplitude` and `frequency` variables in the script to achieve the desired waving effect.

4. Replace the flag texture image (`flag-palestine.jpg`) with the actual URL of your Palestinian flag image for a more accurate representation.
